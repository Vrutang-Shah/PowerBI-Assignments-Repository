# PowerBI
This repository contains all the PowerBI assignments given to me by iNeuron faculties as a part of the "Full Stack Data Science" course. Each assignment is placed in a separate folder with all the necessary files and instructions. The purpose of this repository is to showcase my progress and growth in my learning journey with PowerBI.

The assignments cover various aspects of PowerBI, including data visualization, data analysis, report creation, and more. I have used real-world datasets to demonstrate my ability to apply PowerBI to solve real-world business problems.

This repository serves as a reference for my skills and knowledge in PowerBI, and demonstrates my ability to apply what I have learned in real-world scenarios. I hope that this repository will help other students, as well as potential employers, to better understand my skills and abilities in PowerBI.
